## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you are using the correct version of NodeJS.

If you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) installed simply run (each time you work on the project):

```shell
nvm use
```

If you don't already have the right version of node installed this will prompt you to run:

```shell
nvm install
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

### Start dev server

```shell
yarn start
```

## Build

```shell
yarn build
```
